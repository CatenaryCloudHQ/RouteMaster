Zone delegation in Route53 cross-account is complicated. RouteMaster simplifies zone management in one account with fine-grained permissions for each zone and subdomain.

The clients that use zones will need to make more effort to update zones. The can not import zones directly as the most Construct imply.

This is the trade-off.
